I'm so glad you're thinking of becoming a mentor!
Are you happier being pinged with @mentor-yourSkillSet questions, chatting directly to the new modder in DM, or even, doing a workshop, which is, you making a thing while saying what you are thinking out loud?
For the workshop, you can solo it or have an interlocutor (me for example) to talk to, the interlocutor also keeps an eye of the chat to voice the questions so you don't have to multi-task as much.

We've got a bunch of specialist roles, we can add more of course.
mentor-cs (general use of the Construction Set)
mentor-script (how to write a script in mw-script)
mentor-interior (how to create and decorate an interior cell)
mentor-dungeon (how to create and clutter a dungeon)
mentor-landscape (how to edit landscape and clutter it)
mentor-dialogue (how to create dialogues for quests)
mentor-lua (how to code in lua for MWSE)
mentor-openmw-lua (how to code in lua for OpenMW)
mentor-blender (how to create models using blender)
mentor-textures (how to create and edit textures for Morrowind)
mentor-shader (how to make shaders for Morrowind)

We're thinking January for the event.
