As questions are asked and answered in the forum threads, they are categorised and organised into a browsable/searchable FAQ (ideally from discord)

**Q. Can you just rename an ESP manually, before release, or would that create a problem? I read people talking about it being problematic to do that once you release a mod, especially if it's related to another mod. Why is that a problem?**
A. 

**Q. How do I add or remove a Master File (ESM) from an existing ESP?**
A. 

**Q. I keep reading that veteran modders use all sorts of exterior tools, apart from the Construction Set. Things like Wrye Mash, TESPCD etc. Can I have a list of the most popular and updated tools used by modders and a short description of what each does?**
A.

**Q. I keep reading the words _Normal_, _Bump_ and _Specular Maps_ associated with Textures? What are those? Do they work on both engines (Vanilla & OpenMW)?**
A.

**Q. What is an _Atlas Texture_? How does it work? Is it a replacement? Does it work with both engines (Vanilla & OpenMW)?**
A. 

**Q. If I want to make a mod that works with Vanilla & OpenMW, what are the most important things (outside of LUA Scripting differences) that I should look out for when designing it?**
A. 

**Q. Is there an actual measurement of Vanilla _Texel Density_ used to build the game originally, so we can have it as a reference to make it consistent with custom assets? How can we manipulate and evaluate Texel Density more precisely on Blender?**
A. 

**Q. I sometimes see cool things on _OAAB Data_ and _Tamriel Data_ that modders use to help them build their projects. What are the most useful Object resources for modding (things like Rulers, Character & Info Markers etc.) that veterans use it often?**
A. 

**Q. What's the best method to copy large number of Objects between different ESPs? Can I also transfer entire Cells between ESPs? If yes, how?**
A. 

**Q. Is it useful to have certain “workflow ESPs” loaded alongside your mod ESP? What would those be and what can they offer?**
A. 

**Q. Is there any important MGE XE Setting we should configure to work with the CSSE?**
A. 

**Q. What are the main bottlenecks of performance that we should look for when modding?**
A. 

**Q. Some mods create dependencies relying on just a couple of Objects and it may be worth removing this in some cases. How can one check dependencies between two mods and how can we manipulate this?**
A.
