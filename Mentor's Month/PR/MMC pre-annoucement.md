With Madness drawing to a close, we're already planning the next event, and this one is brand new! 
We're calling it Mentor's Month (at least for now!) and the goal is not only to help new modders create their first mod, but also for more experienced modders, learn new tricks.
The event is two-fold:
- New modders make a forum thread with their mod idea and Mentors answer their questions (in the thread, over DMs, text or voice chat, whatever is most comfortable!)
- Weekly worshops are held right here in MMC to cover various aspects of modding: Make a dungeon with Seelof, learn how to make a model from Melchior, make a simple quest with Danae, etc

As a mentor you can (some, all, either of the following)
- pick a skillset (mentor-cs, mentor-interior, mentor-quest...)
- answer questions from mentees in the forum
- offer more personal guidance via DMs
- hold a workshop

Now, we need to have **some idea** of how many mentors we could have. If you think you might, react with the mentor emojii and I'll contact you to give you ore information, discuss what sort of mentor you'd like to be. This is not a ocntract signed in blood, we just need to get an idea.
