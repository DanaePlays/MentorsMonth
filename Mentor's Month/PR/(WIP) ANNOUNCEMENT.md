You want to make a mod, but you're not sure where to start. There's guides, videos, tutorials... and it's all a little overwhelming. 

You've made mods before but you are limited because you don't know about scripting, or modelling,  or you can never get the landscape right, etc. 

January is approaching and you don't have an exciting New Year Resolution.

### What you need is **Modding Mastery Month**!

In January, you can:

- make a forum thread where mentors will answer your questions (in your thread or over DM, whatever people are comfortable with)
- join workshops covering most aspects of modding: you can lurk or ask questions and even ....
- follow the mod-along challenge to make your first (second, 100th, or xth) mod with a small house and its exterior, a dungeon beneath it and a couple of quests.

The goal is to learn a ton from mentors, fellow modders and gamers, and/or make a mod by the end of the month.

DISCLAMER
- mentors won't be making your mod. This is not a mod-on-demand event.
- We encourage you to share your mod, but there's no obligation to do so.
