You want to make a mod, but you're not sure where to start. There's guides, videos, tutorials... and it's all a little overwhelming. 

You've made mods before but you are limited because you don't know about scripting, or modelling,  or you can never get the landscape right, etc. 

January is approaching and you don't have an exciting New Year Resolution.

### What you need is **Modding Mastery Month**!

In January, you can:

- make a forum thread (private or public) where mentors will answer your questions (in your thread or over DM, whatever people are comfortable with)
- join workshops covering most aspects of modding: you can lurk or ask questions

The goal is to learn a ton, and/or make your first mod by the end of the month.

DISCLAMER
- mentors won't be making your mod. This is not a mod-on-demand event.
- your mod needs a realistic scope, no way your first mod is going to be a huge landmass with warring factions, naval battles, 100% voice over and a brand new spell-casting system.
