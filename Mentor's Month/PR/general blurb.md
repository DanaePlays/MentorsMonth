The primary goal of Mentor's Month is to foster a vibrant and inclusive Morrowind modding community by providing a dedicated platform for both novice and experienced modders to come together, learn, and create. For newcomers to the modding scene, the event aims to demystify the modding process and guide them in crafting their very first mod. Additionally, Mentor's Month offers a unique opportunity for experienced modders to expand their skillsets and share their expertise with others. By the end of this month-long journey, the community will have collectively produced a showcase of creative and diverse mods, reflecting the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the event. Whether you're a seasoned modder or a complete novice, Mentor's Month is all about embracing the spirit of collaboration, sharing knowledge, and celebrating the world of Morrowind modding.

ABOUT MENTORS
Becoming a mentor presents an opportunity to share your passion for Morrowind modding and contribute to the creation of a stronger, more vibrant community.
As a modder, you've trodden the same path as those just embarking on their modding journey, encountering similar challenges and uncertainties.
Your expertise can make a significant impact by guiding newcomers in your specific modding field. By sharing your knowledge, you empower others to take their first steps in the exciting world of Morrowind modding.
Embrace the sheer satisfaction of nurturing creativity and igniting inspiration in others.
However, Mentor's Month isn't just about teaching; it's also a golden opportunity for personal growth. While serving as a mentor in your specialized skillset, consider participating in workshops to broaden your horizons and expand your modding toolkit. Embrace this two-way exchange, where you can both teach and learn, ultimately enhancing your own skills and making a lasting contribution to the Morrowind modding community. Your journey as a mentor can also be a rewarding path of self-improvement and skill development.
