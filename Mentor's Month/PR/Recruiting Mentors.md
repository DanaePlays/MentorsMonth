o/ We're organising a new modding event called **Modding Mastery Month** where we hope to help new modders make their first mod, but also expand the skillset of more experienced modders.

#### The event is two-fold:

- New modders make a forum thread with their mod idea and Mentors answer their questions (in the thread, over DMs, text or voice chat, whatever is most comfortable!)
- Weekly workshops are held right here in MMC to cover various aspects of modding: Make a dungeon with Seelof, learn how to make a model from Melchior, make a simple quest with Danae, etc

#### As a mentor you can (some, all, any of the following)

- pick a skillset (mentor-cs, mentor-interior, mentor-quest...) because no one knows it all.
- answer questions from mentees in the forum.
- offer more personal guidance via DMs.
- hold a workshop. (you can solo it or have an interlocutor (me for example) to talk to, the interlocutor also keeps an eye of the chat to voice the questions so you don't have to multi-task as much.)

We think you'd make a terrific mentor, even just being around answering questions when and where you can.

What do you say?
