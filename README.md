# Mastery Month
The primary goal of Mentor's Month is to foster a vibrant and inclusive Morrowind modding community by providing a dedicated platform for both novice and experienced modders to come together, learn, and create. For newcomers to the modding scene, the event aims to demystify the modding process and guide them in crafting their very first mod. Additionally, Mentor's Month offers a unique opportunity for experienced modders to expand their skill sets and share their expertise with others. By the end of this month-long journey, the community will have collectively produced a showcase of creative and diverse mods, reflecting the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the event. Whether you're a seasoned modder or a complete novice, Mentor's Month is all about embracing the spirit of collaboration, sharing knowledge, and celebrating the world of Morrowind modding.
